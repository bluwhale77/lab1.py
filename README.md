The lab1.py repository contains the history of version edits made to the lab1.py file, which seeks to perform basic computations given user inputs of two operands and an operator.

The exact requirements of this lab exercise are as follows:

For this lab your goal will be to create a program that calculates two operands given the supplied operator. Your program will run from the Python shell and use the input function to collect operands and operator from the user of your program.

You can download a starter python file named lab1.py from here Download here. You must submit this file (or another file with the same name and respecting these contents) to Canvas after you complete your work.

You are free to implement your calculator however you want, but it must include the following requirements:

1. At least one function.
2. Support at least three operators.
3. Provide output to inform a user how to use your program.

The following program output demonstrates one way your program might work:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to ICS 32 PyCalc!

Enter your first operand: 5
Enter your second operand: 12
Enter your desired operator (+, -, or x): +

The result of your calculation is: 17

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't overthink it! Focus on completing the program quickly using what you already know about Python. Lab exercises will grow in complexity as we move forward. For now, just get the basic calculator working using the requirements specified above.

When your program is complete, submit your lab1.py file on this Canvas page.
